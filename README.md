Hi, everyone

I am a student studying computer programming at the open university in the UK. I am hoping to use what I learn to design and code games. I am looking into many different programming languages and game engines to do this. I am juggling kids and caring duties as well as my uni work to try and achieve the gole of making games. thanks for reading, if you did read this.
